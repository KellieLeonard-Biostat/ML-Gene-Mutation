# Deep Learning-Based Gene Mutation Prediction for Cancer Diagnosis and Precision Medicine

**Abstract**
Cancer remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, with genetic mutations playing a crucial role in its onset, progression, and treatment response. However, the global shortage of pathologists and genetic specialists has led to diagnostic delays, affecting patient outcomes. Deep learning has emerged as a promising tool for automating genetic analysis, offering rapid and accurate mutation prediction. This study evaluates Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for predicting gene mutations associated with various cancer types. The models were trained on a labeled genomic dataset, and their performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The CNN model achieved superior performance with an 88.4% accuracy, demonstrating its potential in genomic medicine and precision oncology. These findings highlight AI's role in bridging diagnostic gaps, supporting clinicians, and improving cancer prognosis.

**1. Introduction**
Cancer is a major global health burden, with an estimated 19.3 million new cases and 10 million deaths reported in 2020 (Sung et al., 2021). Genetic mutations play a significant role in cancer pathogenesis, influencing tumour behavior, prognosis, and treatment response. The ability to accurately detect these mutations is essential for precision medicine, which tailors cancer therapies based on an individual's genetic profile (Huang et al., 2020).
However, a severe shortage of pathologists and genetic specialists has created a major challenge in cancer diagnostics. A study by Wilson et al. (2022) revealed that in low-income regions, there is only one pathologist per million people, leading to delayed diagnoses, misclassifications, and limited access to precision medicine. Even in developed countries, increasing cancer incidence has overwhelmed pathology services, emphasising the urgent need for automated AI-driven solutions.

**1.1 The Role of AI in Genomic Medicine**
Deep learning models have shown unprecedented accuracy in cancer diagnostics, particularly in histopathology, radiology, and genomics (Esteva et al., 2019). AI-based genetic analysis can enhance mutation detection, reduce diagnostic workload, and facilitate faster clinical decision-making.
This study explores the use of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in predicting gene mutations based on cancer type. By leveraging deep learning, we aim to enhance precision oncology, reduce diagnostic delays, and support clinical decision-making in resource-limited healthcare settings.

**1.2 Objectives**
1.	Develop deep learning models (MLP and CNN) for predicting gene mutations.
2.	Evaluate model performance based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
3.	Assess AI's potential to automate genetic mutation analysis and improve cancer diagnostics.

**2. Methodology**
**2.1 Dataset**
The dataset used in this study consists of labeled gene mutation data extracted from cancer patients. It includes:
•	Gene name
•	Mutation type
•	Cancer type (classification label)
The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to remove missing values and inconsistencies.

**2.2 Data Preprocessing**
•	One-hot encoding was applied to categorical gene data.
•	Feature scaling ensured uniformity in input values.
•	Data splitting: 80% training, 20% validation.

**2.3 Model Architectures**
**2.3.1 Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**
•	Three fully connected layers with ReLU activation.
•	Dropout layer (0.3) to prevent overfitting.
•	Softmax output layer for multi-class classification.

**2.3.2 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
•	1D convolutional layers to capture genetic sequence patterns.
•	Max-pooling layers for feature reduction.
•	Fully connected dense layers for classification.

**2.4 Model Training & Evaluation**
•	Optimiser: Adam
•	Loss function: Categorical cross-entropy
•	Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
 
**3. Results & Discussion**
**3.1 Model Performance**
The MLP and CNN models were evaluated on the validation dataset, and their performance is summarised below:
Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1-score
MLP	85.2%	83.9%	81.7%	82.8%
CNN	88.4%	87.1%	86.3%	86.7%

**3.1.1 CNN Model Superiority**
The CNN model outperformed the MLP, achieving an 88.4% accuracy. This aligns with findings from previous research, where CNNs demonstrated high effectiveness in recognizing genomic sequence patterns (Alzubaidi et al., 2021). The model's ability to extract hierarchical genetic features improved its classification ability, making it better suited for mutation prediction.

**3.2 Training & Validation Curves**
To visualise model performance, accuracy and loss curves were plotted:

These plots confirmed that CNN achieved better generalisation, with lower validation loss compared to MLP.

**3.3 Implications for Healthcare**
The results suggest that deep learning can significantly enhance cancer diagnostics. By automating gene mutation prediction, AI can:
•	Bridge the shortage of pathologists by reducing manual analysis.
•	Enable earlier diagnosis, improving survival rates.
•	Facilitate personalised medicine, ensuring patients receive targeted therapies based on genetic profiles.
 
**4. Conclusion**
This study demonstrated that CNN-based deep learning models can effectively predict gene mutations associated with cancer, outperforming MLP classifiers. These findings support the integration of AI-driven genomics into clinical workflows, addressing diagnostic bottlenecks and improving precision oncology. Future research should focus on larger datasets, model explainability, and clinical validation to enhance real-world applicability.
